        <h3>About the Cure</h3>
          <p>The Cure are an English rock band formed in Crawley, West Sussex, in 1978.
          The band members have changed several times, with guitarist, lead vocalist and songwriter Robert Smith the only constant member. 
          The band's debut album was <span class="album-link"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Imaginary_Boys">Three Imaginary Boys</a></span> (1979) and this, along with several early singles, placed the band in the post-punk and new wave movements that had sprung up in the wake of the punk rock revolution in the United Kingdom. 
          Beginning with their second album, <span class="album-link"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventeen_Seconds">Seventeen Seconds</a></span> (1980), the band adopted a new, increasingly dark and tormented style, which, together with Smith's stage look, had a strong influence on the emerging genre of gothic rock as well as the subculture that eventually formed around the genre.</p>
